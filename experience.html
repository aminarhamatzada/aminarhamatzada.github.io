                    <p>As a Code Coach, I taught children aged 5 to 18 in various programming languages, including Java, Python, and Scratch. 
                        I managed class sizes ranging from one-on-one sessions to groups of up to 15 students. This role required me to take responsibility for young learners and ensure parental satisfaction. 
                        I found immense joy in knowing that I made a difference in children's lives, fostering their interest in programming.</p>

                    <p>I was accepted into a comprehensive four-month cybersecurity program where I learned the fundamentals of security and privacy. 
                        Each week, I completed projects to practice our classroom skills, covering topics like password hashing, SSH and Linux, networking, malware, data, and privacy. 
                        The program culminated in a group project on DDoS attacks and unauthorized network access, which we presented to our peers.</p>

                         Working in groups, we created projects to present, which were either websites or apps.</p>
